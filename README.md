## 🧠 What I'm Working On

I'm a senior CS student at UNC Chapel Hill doing undergrad research in brain‑computer interfaces with Dr. Raghavendra Pothukuchi. My current focus is building real‑time benchmarking infrastructure for BCI signal processing — and eventually turning that into a company.

## 💼 Experience

* **CEO & Founder | Edge Carolina** · *Feb 2024 – Present*
  * Founded a 150+ member 501(c)(3) teaching software engineering through real product development.
  * Raised **$5 k+** for events & hardware; launched the [Edge Carolina website](https://www.edgecarolina.com) to drive community engagement.

* **Technical Manager | NEXUS, Method Inc.** · *Jun – Aug 2025*
  * Led a 13‑person intern team shipping a discovery‑first knowledge‑management platform (Next.js 15, Firebase, Firestore, Google Drive REST).
  * Bootstrapped **~40 k lines** of foundational code, navigated a mid‑program Chrome‑extension → web‑app pivot, and delivered through two back‑to‑back 5‑day sprints.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [CORTEX](https://github.com/WestonVoglesonger/CORTEX)
**Common Off‑implant Runtime Test Ecosystem for BCI Kernels**
Production‑grade benchmarking framework for brain‑computer interface signal processing built on an AWS‑inspired primitives architecture.
* C engine + Python CLI measuring latency, jitter, throughput, and memory under real‑time deadlines.
* Discovered the **"Idle Paradox"** — idle systems produce *worse* latency due to DVFS effects.
* 260+ commits, 100 k+ lines of code. `C` `Python`

### NEXUS
**Method's Knowledge Management Hub**
Discovery‑first internal platform with faceted search, structured curation, and conversational retrieval across thousands of documents.
* 63 composite Firestore indexes for sub‑200 ms multi‑faceted queries; cursor‑based pagination with client‑side relevance scoring.
* Google SSO, Drive integration, admin entity management, bookmarks. `Next.js` `Firebase` `TypeScript`

### [DueNorth](https://github.com/WestonVoglesonger/DueNorth)
**Course & Assignment Tracker**
Minimal Next.js app for tracking courses and assignments with optional Canvas LMS import.
* NextAuth (Email + Google), Prisma + SQLite, secure token‑based email verification and password reset.
* React Query, Zod validation, rate‑limited API endpoints. `TypeScript` `Next.js` `Prisma`
